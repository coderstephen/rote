# Rote
Plain and simple task and build tool.

## Really? *Another* build tool?
Failures of other tools:

- Non-native tools themselves depend on interpreters to be installed, like Node.js, Python, or Ruby. This introduces additional complexity that does not come from a project itself, but the build tool.
- Nonstandard or confusing configuration syntaxes.
- Making you write code instead of defining tasks.
